# ST_Parser
This repository is a project that turns Structured Text from the IEC 61131 Standard into Web Aseembly.
The imported functions are meant to add I/O features when uploading the code to a microcontroller.
As a way to interact with the input and output ports, I am using the keywords INPUT_PIN_n and OUTPUT_PIN_n, where n is the number of the desired pin
